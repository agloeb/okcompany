                The plastic spinners spun but looked like shit and the cardboard box had no window forviewing, just we believe everyone everywhere, THAT’s why we invented the functional lowrider at 1/4 scale across the box Buddy complimented in the hobby shop as the clerk demonstrated four hydraulic sequences. But now Federico doesn’t like the RC like he thought so he’s asking full price, never used but for demo, box in tact, tuned up with silver trumpet inside.</p>

                For the way I want to. For the way it gets done
                Ground down in the grooves of buffet drawers.
                Keeping it clean really doesn’t matter anymore
                With the tracks all busted out. So like I said

            <p>For browing the quails I like to get my skillet quiet and calm by removing it from the house for a while and making it walk out to the pasture with the cattle. Most of them are going to the sale barn next week and I’m going to wear my pearls and loafers something different than before since they have been such fine cattle. Skillet can get out there and understand what it means to load big creatures up and drive double clutch to Bellville and back in loafers. Late at night after you got a wasp in your pop in your mouth inside your back cheek. </p>

            <p>Wind blows through the wind break whether or not my cowlick stays down and every time I’m panicked by it. Every one of the swallows sit still for a minute on top of the grain bins watching me freak. It doesn’t bother my brother. He carries on painting pterodactyls flying by moons when I come in. Whenever I walk in his room he acts like its a whole crowd saying This one goes out to the three old ladies in the back. You know who you are. He did the same thing when I forgot to drop the auger and snapped the power line. That one was for the three old ladies in the back. We had to pull out the kerosene lamps from under the stairs to make supper. <br><br>We’re going to the Paul Boyer Animated Carvings Museum. My brother always takes me to muzams when things get slow and with the line still down its slower yet. Besides the High Banks Hall of Fame National Midget Auto Racing Museum this one with all the wooden drummers and potbelly dancers is where he likes to take me. Exposed metal rods pump up into knees and elbows. Wobbling dummy heads with no one attending the room. The action is smooth everywhere in there.

Repeating mounds eight feet tall at their peak with thirty-two inch gaps from base to base. Let your ducks lose in there see how long it’ll take to find them. No more waking up with the blathering and slip slap feet on my flat roof.  </p>

            <p>After reading the Joy of Cooking we’re going to bring out the military drums play a little percussion for the people in the park. Whole town and only a few of them got the christmas lights out and the inflatable santa hanging from the library trailer home. All the shelves were gifted by people moving out of town.
                <br><br>
                Today we learned about meat pastries and meat pie toppings thinking we could do something extravagent like that for the community luncheon. Meat pies is where the true cuisine of the country dwells. 
                <br><br>
                Everyone tells the drummers vitame vas when they get in line with their styrofoam plates. We got our drums and rocking chairs stored in the basement where we have these kind of meals and drink wine coolers. I don’t suspect anything is laying there under the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. </p>

                Looks like an underpainting.<br>
                If you take a few steps back though, it doesn’t seem to mind the space.<br>
                I’m not sure.<br>
                Get out the picture of that tiny house the tiny picture I mean who did that one? It’s got the same thing going. I get the same thing going when it’s late out and I’m still walking around mean, you know how people say I got a yellowness to me.<br>
                Don’t get a color from people. <br>
                Well I’ve done it before and’ll do it again by the time I get back to the wide spot in the road where I’m meeitng Romana’s kid Shallot later tonight. Says he’s found the only way up to the top of them turbines. Got to bust through the maintainence door with a hammer but he’s strong. Don’t matter how loud it is, could be rubber could be steel, no one’s around to hear. Then we’ll just shimmy up to Hong Kong.<br> 
                Why?<br>
                Shallot says there’s a lot of crazy shit in those big tubes, like spyware and cameras we ain’t never seen before. For me, I would just like to see him trying to explain it all when we reach for techno-glory and get a three-hundred foot ladder. He’s so worried about one of the arms flying off and stabbing him while he’s working in the field. Hundred foot blade stabbing him. Thru him and into the dirt of his cedar covered eighty acres.

            <p>Coyotes are scaredy cats that’s why they walk in packs in the fields and scream. Nothing has spooked them yet so they cry an anticipatory cry to beat their own fear to the punch. Recently though they’ve been coming up to the porch in the early mornings. It has something to do with their size getting bigger and bigger. They used to be able to watch us from below the alfalfa line and now we shoot them from the back of the truck driving in squares around Elm 30 Fir 31. Blasting  ripped mp3s of their cries over the speakers produces a wild effect further down by Granite and Hickory, two sections past the house where they scream navigating through the old outbuildings.

            <p>Pending the council’s decision, my whereabouts are going to be limited to the VFW which I had builit out with a little room wide enough for me to roll over from my back to belly and tall enough for me to stand three quarters and just long enough. Pending that whole deal I’ll be back there with plenty to keep me occupied like the stamp price arguments I can hear through the pencil hole I made in the back wall connected to the post office. That’s where it’s all going to be once I’m pent. </p>
