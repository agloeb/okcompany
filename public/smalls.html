    The grass stain boys were cheerful this morning. At the station they said Today is the only day where all the numbers add up to 11, and rearranged they spell out a series of good fortunes. The boys were electric and tall like telephone poles, milled pine bodies. Electro mechanical light rushed along by porters pushed the boys slightly out of the way. They're knees were covered in jeans and green and dark yellow daffodils. You can use the entire daffodil in the kitchen, being it farm to table, if you just stop draining the blue pesticide over them they said. They flicked the lingering petals off their pants. It was nearly 7 o'clock and the sun was already short and refracted by broken pieces of insulators left up high never removed by the department of attrition which according to the boys was sorely under staffed.

    good looking player with a good player playing. we got it all sunc up with those videos we found. when you see motor city you won’t see anything it’s invisible and very short. if it appears to be running faster than normal then well it probably is. Thibodeaux is on all different version whether it’s motor city or Colon just south of Cedar Bluffs. On the way to Colon Thibodeaux might have been the most amazing I’ve ever seen. I hope you can make it to see. When everything is jittered and paused and my hat flying off into the crowd from the wind that just means we got everything sunc up. Turn around into the automatic echoautomatic sound of the hardware. What we’re doing is taking our time with this. With the hardware it’s about recovering and gathering the frito lay boxes for use as splints to level the kitchen table’s wobble.

    If you go down Reynolds it’s gonna be mud and if you go past Leona’s and the old bank it’s mud and if you try Elm you’re with bur oaks and sand hill plums and grasshoppers. Smack your chest with their faces. Nothing fast enough to dodge a grasshopper coming out of the gravel. At least nothing I know of. 
<br><br>
    We panel the plaster. We panel all the bug bodies into the plaster while grasshoppers are shooting off from the porch. Their casings rip the heads off our milo. I want to hang my bird pictures on the wall. The most handsome turkey I’ve ever seen eats grasshoppers and I have the upmost respect for that. I caught her in the crick south of our section, so well I was out beyond my scope, beyond what I was registered, into Kramel’s pasture where the most beautiful game meet. 
    <br><br>
    That day we panelled the plaster and improved the white of my room. Wood grain is softer on your eyes and makes my turkey feel more at home. Tonight sleeping on the sleeping porch with my brother on the top bunk and my uncle tucked into the west corner, their is no game to flush out of my room.

    Let’s cross this reminder off I want to have it inside me. If you retold it to us all once you’ve reached and pulled and gutted it out on the block table ready for the electric saw you would think you were the most accountable. Trinities in between your knees. One at a time we push our fingers Back into your forehead. And if you thought the whole day over again once you’ve gutted your little crappie, you might find it took a few too many blows on the shore. Toss my addition to the pot luck into the pond. Costly decision ahead of the night we intend to have.

    <p>Federico doesn’t like his remote control Monte Carlo like he thought he would. 
        The plastic spinners spun but looked like shit and the cardboard box had no window forviewing, just we believe everyone everywhere, THAT’s why we invented the functional lowrider at 1/4 scale across the box Buddy complimented in the hobby shop as the clerk demonstrated four hydraulic sequences. But now Federico doesn’t like the RC like he thought so he’s asking full price, never used but for demo, box in tact, tuned up with silver trumpet inside.</p>

<div class="text-block" id="buffet" style="display: none;">
    <p>Like I said I ain’t an artist but I’ve learned
        How to use shipping and parcel packing services
        For the way I want to. For the way it gets done
        Ground down in the grooves of buffet drawers.
        Keeping it clean really doesn’t matter anymore
        With the tracks all busted out. So like I said
        I ain’t an artist but I got the buffet second hand.</p>

<div class="text-block" id="maillard" style="display: none;">
    <p>For browing the quails I like to get my skillet quiet and calm by removing it from the house for a while and making it walk out to the pasture with the cattle. Most of them are going to the sale barn next week and I’m going to wear my pearls and loafers something different than before since they have been such fine cattle. Skillet can get out there and understand what it means to load big creatures up and drive double clutch to Bellville and back in loafers. Late at night after you got a wasp in your pop in your mouth inside your back cheek. </p>
</div>
<div class="text-block" id="cowlick" style="display: none;">
    <p>Wind blows through the wind break whether or not my cowlick stays down and every time I’m panicked by it. Every one of the swallows sit still for a minute on top of the grain bins watching me freak. It doesn’t bother my brother. He carries on painting pterodactyls flying by moons when I come in. Whenever I walk in his room he acts like its a whole crowd saying This one goes out to the three old ladies in the back. You know who you are. He did the same thing when I forgot to drop the auger and snapped the power line. That one was for the three old ladies in the back. We had to pull out the kerosene lamps from under the stairs to make supper. <br><br>We’re going to the Paul Boyer Animated Carvings Museum. My brother always takes me to muzams when things get slow and with the line still down its slower yet. Besides the High Banks Hall of Fame National Midget Auto Racing Museum this one with all the wooden drummers and potbelly dancers is where he likes to take me. Exposed metal rods pump up into knees and elbows. Wobbling dummy heads with no one attending the room. The action is smooth everywhere in there.

    <p>Once we’ve done one, the rest of the hills are just replicas. Perfectly mapped out and plastered to a semi-gloss finish. Repeating mounds eight feet tall at their peak with thirty-two inch gaps from base to base. Let your ducks lose in there see how long it’ll take to find them. No more waking up with the blathering and slip slap feet on my flat roof.  </p>

    <p>After reading the Joy of Cooking we’re going to bring out the military drums play a little percussion for the people in the park. Whole town and only a few of them got the christmas lights out and the inflatable santa hanging from the library trailer home. All the shelves were gifted by people moving out of town.

        Today we learned about meat pastries and meat pie toppings thinking we could do something extravagent like that for the community luncheon. Meat pies is where the true cuisine of the country dwells. 
        <br><br>
        Everyone tells the drummers vitame vas when they get in line with their styrofoam plates. We got our drums and rocking chairs stored in the basement where we have these kind of meals and drink wine coolers. I don’t suspect anything is laying there under the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. </p>

        I want to kill those brids from the porch. I want to kill them through the picture window we watch the tornado from before going back down to the dirt floor in the cellar. I’ll kill them after I wake up with dirt still on my knees, with the .22 hidden in the pocket in the ceiling. </p>

        Yikes. The way the shower paint—<br>
        Looks like an underpainting.<br>
        If you take a few steps back though, it doesn’t seem to mind the space.<br>
        I’m not sure.<br>
        Get out the picture of that tiny house the tiny picture I mean who did that one? It’s got the same thing going. I get the same thing going when it’s late out and I’m still walking around mean, you know how people say I got a yellowness to me.<br>
        Don’t get a color from people. <br>
        Well I’ve done it before and’ll do it again by the time I get back to the wide spot in the road where I’m meeitng Romana’s kid Shallot later tonight. Says he’s found the only way up to the top of them turbines. Got to bust through the maintainence door with a hammer but he’s strong. Don’t matter how loud it is, could be rubber could be steel, no one’s around to hear. Then we’ll just shimmy up to Hong Kong.<br> 
        Why?<br>
        Shallot says there’s a lot of crazy shit in those big tubes, like spyware and cameras we ain’t never seen before. For me, I would just like to see him trying to explain it all when we reach for techno-glory and get a three-hundred foot ladder. He’s so worried about one of the arms flying off and stabbing him while he’s working in the field. Hundred foot blade stabbing him. Thru him and into the dirt of his cedar covered eighty acres.

<div class="text-block" id="coyotes" style="display: none;">
    <p>Coyotes are scaredy cats that’s why they walk in packs in the fields and scream. Nothing has spooked them yet so they cry an anticipatory cry to beat their own fear to the punch. Recently though they’ve been coming up to the porch in the early mornings. It has something to do with their size getting bigger and bigger. They used to be able to watch us from below the alfalfa line and now we shoot them from the back of the truck driving in squares around Elm 30 Fir 31. Blasting  ripped mp3s of their cries over the speakers produces a wild effect further down by Granite and Hickory, two sections past the house where they scream navigating through the old outbuildings.

    <p>Pending the council’s decision, my whereabouts are going to be limited to the VFW which I had builit out with a little room wide enough for me to roll over from my back to belly and tall enough for me to stand three quarters and just long enough. Pending that whole deal I’ll be back there with plenty to keep me occupied like the stamp price arguments I can hear through the pencil hole I made in the back wall connected to the post office. That’s where it’s all going to be once I’m pent. </p>

    <p>After becoming interested, I ordered two dictionaries and one phrase book in Czech. How Jaternice got to go as Ethernice here I don’t know. The dictionary says J is liver. Ethernice has no liver. Spices, barley, and others, garlic and horseradish give its unique taste. Opinions we all have. As for me, I like celery and peanut butter. Had enough in my grammar school days—he used to be the mayor. Celery in stew and salads I like, we differ there. But we agree on head cheese? </p>

    <p>Lighting up the alley behind the gym with the soft poured floor with bottle rockets till one zipped past those big coat ladies and made a big splash against their porch. Makes your eyes tired and gives a real headache to watch the explosions so close.

    <p>Bagging on main street and the downtown viaduct has blocked off both Sysco entrances. I had enough carrot jello saved up but I was too sick to eat after hearing that Al Green was selling souvenirs wholesale to the public.

        Grandma likes the crazy cruisers best with steering on the left and pedaling on the right. Everyone goes off the berm and back—he used to be the EMT for these things—for quarter mile laps. Last week the champions shot out the window of the hardware doing donuts in the street. Now there’s a crack in front of the miniature town and UFO watertower. It’ll be a while till it’s needed at the tercentennial

        Every shovel has its place on the wall and why shouldn’t every stuffed bird have its place. There’s different kinds of shovels for digging, hauling, launching, and there’s rocks and soil and brush and heels. When it takes the blow from your boot it can’t help but radiate through you. There’s something under this whole place we don’t know about. That’s why Vearl was out here with his dowsing rod even after the well was dropped. Pull it up the surface sure but the hole is never going to be big enough. The closest someone like you can get is the cellar dirt, slobbering back to the picture over a handful of canned peaches.

        I yell out the sounds of interstellar overdrive dun dun ahuhahuhahuh screaming it at the empty downtown buildings and elevators and depot by the deadend viaduct. We get up on the parking garage. It’s the only place you can get an above ground view besides the viaduct but that’s it’s own tricky situation since they’ve walled it off so no one tries climbing the elevator anymore. So we’re up where we can be. J laughs at me and dances on the garage.

        Fast hills on county road Q fast enough to send every one in the back up but I’m freaked watching the intersection for coutny sheriff or car but no one is ever there when we’re therre and now J and I ride back real slow. Off of Q we take it back like a different car. Like we just finished something.

        There have been lowriders in every town we’ve been. Sam could have his own car show. I want my own car show. J wants a new car but he needs a car in the first place and Sam’s have no windows so we mostly take mine to get around at night. To the cubby’s for ginger ale. Or to the access road by the river.

        The fire was started in the butcher shop. Along with the butcher shop it destroyed the restaurant post office building store room and Joe Jennings building. Childs in the front row make it a second generation. They’ve expanded in the past forty years with additions to the shop and warehouse on the east side fo the square. More complete than ever. Plumbing, heating, air conditioning, trenching and backhoeing makes a three day event at Belleville’s Leading Restaurant.

        Watch in front of the gas station for my uncle. My knees are sweaty and stuck to my pants and me and him keep getting mixed up with Bohemian horse racers. If it were up to you you would be out there too. Patty-wagoning with the queen of the harvest. But you never put the car port up, did you? I can tell in the way you drive past in your golf cart looking in. And  I know by how you operate on the work floor, and I can see you mushing through the window, that the levers don’t do what you tell us they do.

        All the buildings are OK. The house is OK and the shed walled with shovels is OK. The Model-A garage is OK too but the silo to the south of the house rolled over and tore up the beans. It’s early enough that you can get those back—and I knew it was hitting right there as soon as they said over the radio that it was touching down two miles east and one south of town. Right on the silo. Next year the the low altitude planes will fly over the county, get the addresses for requests, and fulfil orders for prints of an aerial farm photo new outbuilding no silo in the front.
