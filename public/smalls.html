<p>The grass stain boys were cheerful this morning. At the station they said Today is the only day where all the numbers add up to 11, and rearranged they spell out a series of good fortunes. The boys were electric and tall like telephone poles, milled pine bodies. Electro mechanical light rushed along by porters pushed the boys slightly out of the way. They're knees were covered in jeans and green and dark yellow daffodils. You can use the entire daffodil in the kitchen, being it farm to table, if you just stop draining the blue pesticide over them they said. They flicked the lingering petals off their pants. It was nearly 7 o'clock and the sun was already short and refracted by broken pieces of insulators left up high never removed by the department of attrition which according to the boys was sorely under staffed.

    The power plant is purging its extra energy tonite. I can't sleep through it. I used to sleep so good but I have been punished for talking about it with a stuffed nostril and lousy ear. It's the cleanest plant in the state. Leftover stalks of soybeans run from the edge of the yard to the cooling towers for one mile. Coal is piled next to the tower in between the plant. Purging excess electricity is a cleaning cycle necessary to the longevity of our plant and it only can be done at night. I've resorted to my mouth and the small hairs on my tongue dry up. My lips are white and hard. There must be more than one person in there purging. It's possible it’s automated but someone ought to be getting paid. We use the plant and get some back in dividends from the city for subscribing to the alternative energy programs. A glove gripping a lighting bolt is printed on the top of the invoices. On the dividend line it turns into a thumbs up, lightning coming out of the tip. Behind the electro mechanical coughing of electro popping is a constant hum, in the rails, on purging nights. My nose whistles and steam comes out of two exhausts on the cooling tower.

    The porch fridge has been developing a cough. You can hear it although its faint because everyone has been laying lower, hiding under the stalks so we can’t see them. Before you thrash they sit up and relay their worried messages through the milo. They’re hiding better and the fridge is getting worse. All of them watching probably hear it too and bothers them while they stay alert on us. We’re going to move soon once the bank clears everything and Connie hands over the cash store. We’re gonna sell capers. Starting a store selling sweetheart branded capers.

    Big dog quick stop gas station is busy across from the hog depot and late nite auto shop. Herman’s hermit is with me and we get five pickle tickets each hoping only for matching rubies or peeled bananas. We left his red couch for big dog quick stop with no regrets. Outside by the ice we rip the tickets. Big dog himself flashes red lights on us and hog dealers splash shit on my car. Is it a hermit in a village or a hamlet either way we ask each other. HH runs rubes across his third row and we go back in for ginger ales.

Going to understand what it means to take the whole lot of us to Belleville driving double clutch with my nice pants on. Transtar II saves me from disolving with it’s blue powder coat just the same tone as our room walls when the LED clock tints it up a pesticidic blue.

    The theme of this night is cat. Mop the butts out of your breast pocket or is it chest pocket. I can’t be sure and I mustve left the kitchen faucet on.

    Whoo look for the 
    The corn pile’s getting high enough for us to dig thru
    And not crouch
    <br><br>

    All our cornflake factories are grandmas or endforend. Turns out we make it all in house take it out thru the slow kids at play cross and strigth back in . Crappie twenty three the most on the line. Corn flake. Or she meant meal crusted.

<div class="text-block" id="bunkers" style="display: none;">
<p>
We get three of us out there on the shore digging bunkers into the sand. Each one of us has our own dollar general cooler to carry nothing heavy not even liquids cause we take our milk in jugs just candy berries and the small engine parts that washed up from the river into the pond. You get working fast throwing the little spark plugs and cam lobes out of the space zoned for bunker if you get J to make an orange julius with a couple eggs in it before you go out. He always pours one in a dark red chalice and takes it upstairs for Cherie but keeps quiet about the eggs. We wouldn’t replace her orange juice concentrate just clean the blender and cups.
<br><br>
The way to the shore is hidden by cottonwoods. We cut through a bulge in the creek and there’s no tip toeing across. I tried like Murry the dog did by wadding over to the other side but he must’ve been dog paddling beneath the muddy waters. Got my shorts wet and all our tackle and poles full of water and gunge. Getting up on the culvert is the better way and doesn’t take much longer except for waiting for the livestock trailers to clear the road. When we’re lucky it’s piglets and when not it’s shit. 
<br><br>
I have the only shovel to bring and it’s as long as my forearm and as wide as my two hands together so Sam and J just use their two hands to hurl the sand out of the bunker. Anyway they can carry our styrofoam coolers. The lids rub against the walls of the cooler and squeak out of tune while we walk.

    That centennial everyone grew a beard and got a coupon to the elevator for guessing the pig weight right. 
    Alan couldn’t grow a beard. He’d thrown away the chamois shirt he was wearing once but took it back out of the trash  barrel when he saw it was still in good condition. Well why did I do that that’s not a rag he said and put it on top of his ripped sleeveless. 
    <br><br>
    At the centennial Alan saw Crooney. He just got the wood stairs that fit perfectly in Denton Hall. But the hall committee spent their money on cement ones so Crooney scored. I got the wood ones in storage just never know he told Alan. Crooney’s lady Lucy was there. Well what’d you decide she asked Alan. About what Alan said. I don’t know she said. 
    <br><br>
    Crooney hung baby food jars full of screws under each of Denton Hall’s backup wooden steps. Alan likes to keep jars too. He won’t throw anything away but he’ll move the box it’s in, take it out, and put it back in the box. Sometimes he’ll motivate himself to put a box of boys life magazines and community college notebooks and envelopes from official bills in the burn pile. He puts them in a nice hole, a cave in the pile with branches and fabric chairs for walls, he puts these boxes neatly there so he can retrieve them. 
    <br><br>
    I don't know where I got that’n but it must’ve been slow where the children play Lucy said. She drives fast in the fog past Alan to direct him to the pizza luncheon.

    good looking player with a good player playing. we got it all sunc up with those videos we found. when you see motor city you won’t see anything it’s invisible and very short. if it appears to be running faster than normal then well it probably is. Thibodeaux is on all different version whether it’s motor city or Colon just south of Cedar Bluffs. On the way to Colon Thibodeaux might have been the most amazing I’ve ever seen. I hope you can make it to see. When everything is jittered and paused and my hat flying off into the crowd from the wind that just means we got everything sunc up. Turn around into the automatic echoautomatic sound of the hardware. What we’re doing is taking our time with this. With the hardware it’s about recovering and gathering the frito lay boxes for use as splints to level the kitchen table’s wobble.

    If you go down Reynolds it’s gonna be mud and if you go past Leona’s and the old bank it’s mud and if you try Elm you’re with bur oaks and sand hill plums and grasshoppers. Smack your chest with their faces. Nothing fast enough to dodge a grasshopper coming out of the gravel. At least nothing I know of. 
<br><br>
    We panel the plaster. We panel all the bug bodies into the plaster while grasshoppers are shooting off from the porch. Their casings rip the heads off our milo. I want to hang my bird pictures on the wall. The most handsome turkey I’ve ever seen eats grasshoppers and I have the upmost respect for that. I caught her in the crick south of our section, so well I was out beyond my scope, beyond what I was registered, into Kramel’s pasture where the most beautiful game meet. 
    <br><br>
    That day we panelled the plaster and improved the white of my room. Wood grain is softer on your eyes and makes my turkey feel more at home. Tonight sleeping on the sleeping porch with my brother on the top bunk and my uncle tucked into the west corner, their is no game to flush out of my room.

    Let’s cross this reminder off I want to have it inside me. If you retold it to us all once you’ve reached and pulled and gutted it out on the block table ready for the electric saw you would think you were the most accountable. Trinities in between your knees. One at a time we push our fingers Back into your forehead. And if you thought the whole day over again once you’ve gutted your little crappie, you might find it took a few too many blows on the shore. Toss my addition to the pot luck into the pond. Costly decision ahead of the night we intend to have.

    <p>Federico doesn’t like his remote control Monte Carlo like he thought he would. 
        The plastic spinners spun but looked like shit and the cardboard box had no window forviewing, just we believe everyone everywhere, THAT’s why we invented the functional lowrider at 1/4 scale across the box Buddy complimented in the hobby shop as the clerk demonstrated four hydraulic sequences. But now Federico doesn’t like the RC like he thought so he’s asking full price, never used but for demo, box in tact, tuned up with silver trumpet inside.</p>

Most of them are going to the sale barn next week and I’m going to wear my pearls and loafers something different than before since they have been such fine cattle. Skillet can get out there and understand what it means to load big creatures up and drive double clutch to Bellville and back in loafers. Late at night after you got a wasp in your pop in your mouth inside your back cheek. </p>

<div class="text-block" id="cowlick" style="display: none;">
    <p>Wind blows through the wind break whether or not my cowlick stays down and every time I’m panicked by it. Every one of the swallows sit still for a minute on top of the grain bins watching me freak. It doesn’t bother my brother. He carries on painting pterodactyls flying by moons when I come in. Whenever I walk in his room he acts like its a whole crowd saying This one goes out to the three old ladies in the back. You know who you are. He did the same thing when I forgot to drop the auger and snapped the power line. That one was for the three old ladies in the back. We had to pull out the kerosene lamps from under the stairs to make supper. <br><br>We’re going to the Paul Boyer Animated Carvings Museum. My brother always takes me to muzams when things get slow and with the line still down its slower yet. Besides the High Banks Hall of Fame National Midget Auto Racing Museum this one with all the wooden drummers and potbelly dancers is where he likes to take me. Exposed metal rods pump up into knees and elbows. Wobbling dummy heads with no one attending the room. The action is smooth everywhere in there.

<div class="text-block" id="historical" style="display: none;">
    <p>Once we’ve done one, the rest of the hills are just replicas. Perfectly mapped out and plastered to a semi-gloss finish. Repeating mounds eight feet tall at their peak with thirty-two inch gaps from base to base. Let your ducks lose in there see how long it’ll take to find them. No more waking up with the blathering and slip slap feet on my flat roof.  </p>

<div class="text-block" id="prague" style="display: none;">
    <p>After reading the Joy of Cooking we’re going to bring out the military drums play a little percussion for the people in the park. Whole town and only a few of them got the christmas lights out and the inflatable santa hanging from the library trailer home. All the shelves were gifted by people moving out of town.
        <br><br>
        Today we learned about meat pastries and meat pie toppings thinking we could do something extravagent like that for the community luncheon. Meat pies is where the true cuisine of the country dwells. 
        <br><br>
        Everyone tells the drummers vitame vas when they get in line with their styrofoam plates. We got our drums and rocking chairs stored in the basement where we have these kind of meals and drink wine coolers. I don’t suspect anything is laying there under the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. </p>

<div class="text-block" id="picture" style="display: none;">
    <p>I wanted to kill those birds from the picture window with the .22 hidden in the pocket above the bathroom. Shoot them right through the picture window we watch the tornado from before going down to the dirt floor cellar. 
        <br><br>
        I want to kill those brids from the porch. I want to kill them through the picture window we watch the tornado from before going back down to the dirt floor in the cellar. I’ll kill them after I wake up with dirt still on my knees, with the .22 hidden in the pocket in the ceiling. </p>

        Yikes. The way the shower paint—<br>
        Looks like an underpainting.<br>
        If you take a few steps back though, it doesn’t seem to mind the space.<br>
        I’m not sure.<br>
        Get out the picture of that tiny house the tiny picture I mean who did that one? It’s got the same thing going. I get the same thing going when it’s late out and I’m still walking around mean, you know how people say I got a yellowness to me.<br>
        Don’t get a color from people. <br>
        Well I’ve done it before and’ll do it again by the time I get back to the wide spot in the road where I’m meeitng Romana’s kid Shallot later tonight. Says he’s found the only way up to the top of them turbines. Got to bust through the maintainence door with a hammer but he’s strong. Don’t matter how loud it is, could be rubber could be steel, no one’s around to hear. Then we’ll just shimmy up to Hong Kong.<br> 
        Why?<br>
        Shallot says there’s a lot of crazy shit in those big tubes, like spyware and cameras we ain’t never seen before. For me, I would just like to see him trying to explain it all when we reach for techno-glory and get a three-hundred foot ladder. He’s so worried about one of the arms flying off and stabbing him while he’s working in the field. Hundred foot blade stabbing him. Thru him and into the dirt of his cedar covered eighty acres.

<div class="text-block" id="coyotes" style="display: none;">
    <p>Coyotes are scaredy cats that’s why they walk in packs in the fields and scream. Nothing has spooked them yet so they cry an anticipatory cry to beat their own fear to the punch. Recently though they’ve been coming up to the porch in the early mornings. It has something to do with their size getting bigger and bigger. They used to be able to watch us from below the alfalfa line and now we shoot them from the back of the truck driving in squares around Elm 30 Fir 31. Blasting  ripped mp3s of their cries over the speakers produces a wild effect further down by Granite and Hickory, two sections past the house where they scream navigating through the old outbuildings.

    <p>Pending the council’s decision, my whereabouts are going to be limited to the VFW which I had builit out with a little room wide enough for me to roll over from my back to belly and tall enough for me to stand three quarters and just long enough. Pending that whole deal I’ll be back there with plenty to keep me occupied like the stamp price arguments I can hear through the pencil hole I made in the back wall connected to the post office. That’s where it’s all going to be once I’m pent. </p>

<div class="text-block" id="cuba" style="display: none;">
    <p>After becoming interested, I ordered two dictionaries and one phrase book in Czech. How Jaternice got to go as Ethernice here I don’t know. The dictionary says J is liver. Ethernice has no liver. Spices, barley, and others, garlic and horseradish give its unique taste. Opinions we all have. As for me, I like celery and peanut butter. Had enough in my grammar school days—he used to be the mayor. Celery in stew and salads I like, we differ there. But we agree on head cheese? </p>

<div class="text-block" id="ysidro" style="display: none;">
    <p>Bulls are curled up together knocked fifty gallons of water over. Ysidro said Bulls knocked it into mud now he’s in the chute trying to get someone else like an angel to do his work, burn his piles, eat his supper. Bulls like that wold comfort a baby on a train then wreck your terracotta floor after you invite them back. </p>

I can even get a Kauai island optogram if the cards lay down right next to me, pushed against the ground by the wind, which they have been. We got snow for Halloween. Backpack’s breaking up the most of it like a C-Band satellite interfering. These issues taking ages for now.  </div>

        Miss the mark by a whole lot n break my back but I won’t stop<br>

        Choppers coming down on me but I’m focused and mean<br>
        These days I do it all without my team<br>
        One day I’ll be on the late night show<br>
        Do a high kickin entrance and a sweet ass roll<br>
        Ev’rybody’s gonna love me<br>

<div class="text-block" id="gym" style="display: none;">
    <p>Lighting up the alley behind the gym with the soft poured floor with bottle rockets till one zipped past those big coat ladies and made a big splash against their porch. Makes your eyes tired and gives a real headache to watch the explosions so close. Not much you can do if you’re getting shot at accidentally like those ladies or me and Mr Shoemaker dealing with some other BB gun kids and anyway we rocketeers liked the feeling you get in your eyes. </p>

<div class="text-block" id="sweet" style="display: none;">
    <p>We’re painting the propane tank silver again. I keep falling through terracotta pots and scratching my back but it’s all I have to sit on so I hit the grass and stay on the hot ground. The blue colored herbicide giving a pain in my sweet tooth. I get the same feeling when we pick the pavers out of the sidewalk careful to miss the sharktooth jars.

<div class="text-block" id="bagging" style="display: none;">
    <p>Bagging on main street and the downtown viaduct has blocked off both Sysco entrances. I had enough carrot jello saved up but I was too sick to eat after hearing that Al Green was selling souvenirs wholesale to the public. This was before Al met the whiz-kid who produced his 1982 release, the first record to always approach you from behind like a sneaking thief.

        Grandma likes the crazy cruisers best with steering on the left and pedaling on the right. Everyone goes off the berm and back—he used to be the EMT for these things—for quarter mile laps. Last week the champions shot out the window of the hardware doing donuts in the street. Now there’s a crack in front of the miniature town and UFO watertower. It’ll be a while till it’s needed at the tercentennial

        Every shovel has its place on the wall and why shouldn’t every stuffed bird have its place. There’s different kinds of shovels for digging, hauling, launching, and there’s rocks and soil and brush and heels. When it takes the blow from your boot it can’t help but radiate through you. There’s something under this whole place we don’t know about. That’s why Vearl was out here with his dowsing rod even after the well was dropped. Pull it up the surface sure but the hole is never going to be big enough. The closest someone like you can get is the cellar dirt, slobbering back to the picture over a handful of canned peaches.

        I yell out the sounds of interstellar overdrive dun dun ahuhahuhahuh screaming it at the empty downtown buildings and elevators and depot by the deadend viaduct. We get up on the parking garage. It’s the only place you can get an above ground view besides the viaduct but that’s it’s own tricky situation since they’ve walled it off so no one tries climbing the elevator anymore. So we’re up where we can be. J laughs at me and dances on the garage. 
        <br><br>
        Fast hills on county road Q fast enough to send every one in the back up but I’m freaked watching the intersection for coutny sheriff or car but no one is ever there when we’re therre and now J and I ride back real slow. Off of Q we take it back like a different car. Like we just finished something. 
        <br><br>
        We drive separate most places and I borrow my parent’s car to go see him with a new haircut. 
        <br><br>
        There have been lowriders in every town we’ve been. Sam could have his own car show. I want my own car show. J wants a new car but he needs a car in the first place and Sam’s have no windows so we mostly take mine to get around at night. To the cubby’s for ginger ale. Or to the access road by the river.

        The fire was started in the butcher shop. Along with the butcher shop it destroyed the restaurant post office building store room and Joe Jennings building. Childs in the front row make it a second generation. They’ve expanded in the past forty years with additions to the shop and warehouse on the east side fo the square. More complete than ever. Plumbing, heating, air conditioning, trenching and backhoeing makes a three day event at Belleville’s Leading Restaurant.

        Steely Joe:
        <br>    
        Watch in front of the gas station for my uncle. My knees are sweaty and stuck to my pants and me and him keep getting mixed up with Bohemian horse racers. If it were up to you you would be out there too. Patty-wagoning with the queen of the harvest. But you never put the car port up, did you? I can tell in the way you drive past in your golf cart looking in. And  I know by how you operate on the work floor, and I can see you mushing through the window, that the levers don’t do what you tell us they do.

        All the buildings are OK. The house is OK and the shed walled with shovels is OK. The Model-A garage is OK too but the silo to the south of the house rolled over and tore up the beans. It’s early enough that you can get those back—and I knew it was hitting right there as soon as they said over the radio that it was touching down two miles east and one south of town. Right on the silo. Next year the the low altitude planes will fly over the county, get the addresses for requests, and fulfil orders for prints of an aerial farm photo new outbuilding no silo in the front.
